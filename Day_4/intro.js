//  database 
// database are structured system for starting, managing and retriving data effieciently.

// categories based on how they store the data
//1, Relational (sql database)
// 2. Not realtional Database  (mongodb)

// realtional database are store in the form of table where nonrelational database are store in the form of hireacy.
//in realtional databases once we define schema then we can not change it.


// data migration - for example we have one table it conatin column like name, roll no, age and i want to add one more column address then we create new
// table and add column name , rollno ,age, address that process is called data migration.

// there is no schema in non realtional databases. and store data in json formate

// data modeling
// when wwe creating a database inside a table there is schema that will be inside the databse only
// but in nosql we validate the data on the server itself that is called data modeling.
