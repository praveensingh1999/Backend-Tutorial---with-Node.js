// HTTP Protocol -> internet protocol used for communication in the application layer of networking.
// Req-Res cycle -> where whenever we have to access any data from the server, we send a request to the server and server send back to client .

// http method -> purpose in term of data . Get, Post, Put, Patch, Delete

//Restful API -> Representational state transfer , this is an api development archetiecture that follow some principals that help us to create scaleble, flexible, and effiecnt web server for communication between client and server

//Architectural pointers 
// 1. Uniform Interface - well identification of resources -> /api/signup
//  2. statelessness - we do not store any data on the server
// 3. cachebility - the server should be able to cache response for better peformance and reduce latency.
// 4. Layered System - we implement features in layers.


// http status code -> they tell about the nature of the response that e have got 
// 200 -> success code
// 400 -> client error
// 500 - server error

// React -> it is liberary that is used for createing dynamic ui and frontent
//  node.js -> it is a javascript runtime , that allow to run javascript on the server.


// new node.js project setup
//1. create a folder for your project
// 2. open terminal inside it
// 3. on the terminal type - npm init
// 4. for shortcut type - npm init -y
//5. npm install express

// express.js - it is a fast, unopinionated , minimalist, we framework for node.js that help in building apii for server side development which includes rounting, middleware ,handling and http req/ res processing

// server is event driven - when ever we get the request only the a fxn will be triggered.

// package-lock : it store the stable version of the package that we are using inside our application

// node modulle - file of the package that we use in out project.
